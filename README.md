# Android-Study
This is repository with Kotlin projects on various subjects: from calculator to messenger-bot (in future)
Now available projects are:
  * lab1 -  my first acquaintance with Kotlin. I try to catch the main app phases and print events on the screen (onStart, onPause, etc..)
  * lab2 -  simple calculator with 4 operations: +, -, *, /. Also i use SnackBar (implementation 'com.android.support:design:27.1.1') for user notifications
